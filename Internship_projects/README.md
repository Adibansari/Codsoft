Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This project implements a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic using logistic regression.

Overview
The Titanic survival prediction model leverages the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Methodology
The following steps were followed to build and evaluate the model:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns and converting categorical variables to numerical representations. Missing values in the 'Age' column were filled using the median age.

Model Training: Logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, was selected for its simplicity and interpretability. The scikit-learn library was used to train the logistic regression classifier on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using an accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correct predictions made on unseen data.

Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of 1 on the test data, indicating its strong predictive performance. It provides insights into the importance of different features in determining the survival outcome and allows for easy interpretation of the model's predictions.

Task 2 
The above code demonstrates a machine learning model for predicting movie ratings based on user demographics and movie genres. Here is a brief description of the model:

Data Import: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as pandas and numpy and loading the movie, ratings, and user datasets from CSV files.

Data Preprocessing: The movie dataset is given attribute names, and missing values are checked for both the movie and ratings datasets. The user dataset is also given attribute names.

Data Exploration: The code explores the datasets by displaying a sample of records, getting the dimensions of the datasets, finding unique values, and checking for missing values.

Data Integration: The datasets are merged together based on common columns like MovieID and UserID to create a consolidated dataset containing information about users, movies, and their ratings.

Data Filtering: The consolidated dataset is filtered to include only movies that have been rated by at least a certain threshold number of users (e.g., 100 users). This helps in focusing on movies with sufficient ratings data.

Data Encoding: Categorical variables like gender, age, occupation, and genre are encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical form, suitable for training a machine learning model.

Model Training: The encoded features (X) and target variable (y) are split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. A linear regression model is then created and trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing data, and the performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics.

Result: The MSE and RMSE values are printed, indicating the performance of the model in predicting movie ratings based on user demographics and movie genres.

This model can be further enhanced by incorporating more advanced algorithms, feature engineering, or hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.

Task 3
Iris Species Classification Model
The above code demonstrates a machine learning model for predicting the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. Here is a brief description of the model:

Data Import: The code imports necessary libraries such as pandas and numpy and loads the Iris dataset.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is divided into features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and target variable (species).

Data Exploration: The code explores the dataset by displaying a sample of records and getting the dimensions of the dataset.

Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. A Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is then created and trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing data, and the performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Results: The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values are calculated and printed, indicating the performance of the model in classifying Iris flower species based on their measurements.

Description:
The above code demonstrates a machine learning model for predicting sales based on advertising data. It follows a systematic approach to build and evaluate the model using the provided dataset.

Steps involved in the code:

Data Import: The code imports essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It then loads the advertising dataset using the read_csv() function.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The code performs EDA to gain insights into the dataset. It uses libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations, such as pair plots, to analyze the relationships between advertising variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales.

Feature Engineering: The code prepares the dataset for model training by extracting meaningful features. It creates variables like total ad spend, ad spend on specific channels, seasonality indicators, and customer demographics to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Train-Test Split: The code splits the dataset into a training set and a testing/validation set using the train_test_split() function from scikit-learn. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Model Selection: The code selects an appropriate model for sales prediction. It includes options like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks, depending on the complexity of the problem and available resources.

Model Training: The code trains the selected model on the training dataset using the fit() function. The model learns the relationship between the advertising features and sales by minimizing the error or maximizing the likelihood of the observed sales values.

Model Evaluation: The code evaluates the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. It compares the model's predictions on the testing/validation set against the actual sales values to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Model Optimization: The code fine-tunes the model by adjusting hyperparameters or applying regularization techniques to improve its performance. It involves an iterative process of experimentation and refinement to achieve the best possible predictions.

Sales Prediction: The code utilizes the trained model to predict sales based on new advertising inputs. It takes the relevant advertising data as input and generates sales predictions. Preprocessing steps are applied to the input data to ensure consistency with the training process.
Conclusion:
The sales prediction model showcased in the code demonstrates the process of building, training, evaluating, and utilizing a machine learning model for sales forecasting based on advertising data. It enables businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and make informed decisions to drive sales growth.
